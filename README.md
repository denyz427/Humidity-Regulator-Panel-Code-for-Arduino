# Humidity_Regulator_Panel_Code_for_Arduino
  This code used to monitor humidity and temperature by using DHT sensor. When the humidity falls below the lower threshold, it will trigger a relay to activate a misting system until the humidity exceeds the upper threshold.
  The current humidity and temperature can be seen on a 2×16 LCD screen, and the upper humidity threshold can be modified by using 2 push-buttons.
Components used:
1. Any Arduino Microcontroller Board (×1)
2. 2×16 LCD (×1)
3. Relay (×1)
4. Push-button (×2)
5. Misting system (×1)
